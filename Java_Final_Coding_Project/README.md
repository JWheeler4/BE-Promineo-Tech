WAR is a digital version of the card game, also referred to as WAR, which runs in the console. To start the application, using your Java compatible IDE of choice, open file App.java located in the directory "BE-Promineo-Tech\Java_Final_Coding_Project\src\war_game" and click the 'Run' button.

* Players begin in the Main Menu where they can either start a game or exit the application.
* If a game is started, players enter their names and a single game of WAR is simulated.

Some notible traits of this variant of the game:
* After each "battle," rather than winning the cards, the player who wins recieves a point.
* When a "battle" results in a tie, a "war" (as shown in the image above) does not occur, instead, no points are awarded to either player.
* When the end of the players' decks are reached the game ends.
* In the case where both players have the same number of points at the end of the game, the game will result in a tie.
