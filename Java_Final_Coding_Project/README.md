WAR is a digital version of the card game, also referred to as WAR, which runs on the Java console line.

* Players enter their name and a single game of WAR is simulated.

Notible traits of this variant of the card game:
* After each "battle," rather than winning the cards, the player who wins recieves a point.
* When a "battle" results in a tie, rather than a "war" occuring, no points are awarded.
* When the end of each players' decks are reached the game ends.
* In the case where both players have the same number of points at the end of the game, the game will result in a tie.
